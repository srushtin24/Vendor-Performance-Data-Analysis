This project performs in-depth Vendor performance analytics using liquor inventory data.
It integrates SQL + Python + Visualization + Statistical testing to identify:

✔ Most profitable vendors
✔ Vendors with low sales but high margins (ideal for pricing push)
✔ Capital locked in unsold inventory
✔ Bulk-order price advantage assessment
✔ Top vendors driving 65.7% of total procurement
✔ Pricing elasticity & profitability relationships
✔ Underperforming stock — slow moving products, dead inventory
